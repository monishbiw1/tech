        A journey that began on <strong>22 July 2025</strong>, grew through late-night talks, moving boxes,
        birthday memories, and turns into a beautiful, mutual “yes” in April 2027.

          <h3>July 2025 • The Beginning</h3>
          <p>We matched on Aisle on 22 July 2025 and met on 26 July at Fursat Ke Pal. We stayed till 4:30 AM under the sky, talking deeply and laughing over a cheeky alphabet game.</p>

          <h3>August 2025 • New Ashok Nagar to Vaishali</h3>
          <p>In the first week itself, life moved fast. She shifted from New Ashok Nagar to Vaishali, and we packed everything together—boxes, clothes, and all the details of her world.</p>
          <p>Before that move, at her New Ashok Nagar flat, I gifted her a 30-piece earrings set. While setting up her Vaishali room, I also got curtains for her place.</p>

          <h3>Five Days That Changed Us</h3>
          <p>When office trouble unexpectedly gave me five leaves, I stayed at her room for those full five days. She left for office each morning and returned each evening—those days became our real bonding chapter.</p>

          <h3>Dates, Birthdays & Friends</h3>
          <p>We had a sky-view dinner date with lots of pictures. Before her 3-day Lansdowne girls trip, I made her birthday special with a wall poster of her pictures, chocolates, sweets, and cookies.</p>
          <p>Her birthday night was celebrated at her room with Manju, and on the weekend we went to Fursat Ke Pal with her friends—Lakhan, Priya, Divya, Geeta, and others.</p>

          <h3>February 2026 • Valentine Week</h3>
          <p>On Chocolate Day, I gifted her chocolates. On Rose Day, she gave me a rose and chocolate. This year, Valentine’s plans are at my room—with a clear conversation about balance, effort, and showing up for each other equally.</p>

          <h3>2026 to April 2027 • Choosing Forever</h3>
          <p>Through 2026, we grow by communicating better, respecting each other’s space, sharing responsibilities, and supporting each other’s goals. We keep building memories—small dates, festivals, family introductions, and trust.</p>
          <p>In early 2027, both families meet. There are disagreements and stressful moments, but we stay patient, kind, and united. No drama can break what we build with honesty.</p>
          <p><strong>April 2027:</strong> We marry with full consent, joy, and blessings—because we chose each other again and again, every single day.</p>

        <h2>Our Promise</h2>
        <p>
          Love is not “no matter what happens.” Love is “whatever happens, we handle it together with respect.”
          This is our story of effort, care, and a future we build side by side.
